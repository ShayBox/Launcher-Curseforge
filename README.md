# MultiMC-Curseforge

A simple Go program that handles Curseforge's custom protocol and ccip files
1. Reads the [CurseForge] `.ccip` file or `curseforge://` protocol  
2. Requests the [CurseForge] to get the zip url  
3. Launches [MultiMC] with the `--import` flag, with the url  
4. Downloads the modpack icon into the icons folder

Instructions:
  - macOS - Move `MultiMC-Curseforge.app` into `Applications`
  - Linux - [AUR] or Manually install files into system
  - Windows - Move `MultiMC-Curseforge.exe` into `MultiMC` folder and execute as admin

Note: Having the Curse app installed may break this.
